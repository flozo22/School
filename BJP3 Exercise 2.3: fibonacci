// The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers in which the first two elements are 1,
// and each following element is the sum of the two preceding elements. 
// The mathematical definition of each kth Fibonacci number is the following:

// F(k): 
// k > 2 : F(k-1) + F(k-2) 
// k <= 2 : 1

// The first 12 Fibonacci numbers are:

// 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
// Write a piece of code that uses a for loop to compute and print the first 12 Fibonacci numbers. 
// (You may include other code, such as declaring variables before the loop, if you like.)

int a1 = 1;
int a2 = 1;
for (int i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    
    System.out.print(a1 + " ");
    int sum = a1 + a2;
    a1 = a2;
    a2 = sum;
